# opencoo — Architecture

> Contributor-facing summary. The full internal design-of-record (~160 KB) is kept local and gitignored; this file covers what anyone writing code against the repo needs to know. For the canonical decision list with rationale, see `docs/decisions-resolved.md`. For what we're shipping, when, and how, see `PRD.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `THREAT-MODEL.md`.

## 1. What opencoo is

opencoo ingests documents and meeting transcripts, compiles them into a per-domain Markdown wiki stored in Gitea (the Karpathy LLM-Wiki pattern — knowledge is **pre-synthesized at ingestion time, not retrieved at query time**; no RAG, no vectors), and serves that wiki to AI agents via Gitea's native MCP server. Business model: open-source engine + paid per-client implementations; each client runs its own docker-compose instance.

## 2. Load-bearing decisions

These are the decisions that make opencoo different from the alternatives it rejects. Do not relitigate without explicit cause; each has a corresponding entry in `docs/decisions-resolved.md`.

1. **No RAG / no vector search / no semantic retrieval.** Agents navigate by exact path: `index.md → category → page`. Pages are compiled by LLMs at ingestion. The justification (Barman et al. 2026, interference/forgetting in semantic stores) is load-bearing for the whole product.
2. **No external LLM gateway.** Use the **Vercel AI SDK** directly inside the engine process — no LiteLLM, no proxy container, no Python. The March 2026 LiteLLM supply-chain attack is the blocker.
3. **Gitea is both the storage backend AND the agent-facing MCP server.** `packages/gitea-wiki-mcp-server/` (already shipping, in partner production) is the canonical MCP surface. Do not build a custom wiki MCP server.
4. **n8n is an optional overlay**, not a dependency. The core engine must run without it. Automation is an adapter (`AutomationAdapter`), not a foundation.
5. **UI-first configuration.** `.env` contains only `DATABASE_URL`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PORT`, `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`. Everything else — providers, integrations, domains, users, schedules — lives in Postgres and is edited via the management UI.
6. **Append-only logs.** `log.md`, event logs, audit tables never rewrite or delete. Agents that try to rewrite whole files are a known failure mode; the format prevents it.
7. **Progressive disclosure.** Never load the full wiki into LLM context. Three levels: `index.md` (always) → category pages (per task) → specific pages (on demand). LLM attention collapses past ~100–120 competing items.
8. **Front-load critical context.** In schema files, prompts, and templates, the most important rules live in the first ~100 lines — LLMs have a U-shaped attention curve.
9. **Workflow and skill repositories are catalog-class domains, not a parallel primitive.** `domains.class ∈ {knowledge, catalog-workflows, catalog-skills}`; catalog ingest rides the existing `SourceAdapter → Classifier → Compiler → wikiWrite` pipeline gated by `content_kind` to round-trip executable bodies losslessly.
10. **The wiki is the durable artifact; engines are stateless reproducers.** Compiled pages outlive every engine restart, image upgrade, and provider migration. Engine state can be reconstructed from the wiki + audit tables; the inverse is not true. Tools that build a wiki as a side effect of conversations — resetting on container restart, or persisting only inside a vendor-hosted control plane — treat the brain as cache. opencoo treats it as the substrate. The success-criteria upgrade gate (PRD §5 #10) and the Gitea-as-storage decision (#3 above) jointly enforce this.
11. **No external control plane.** Auth, UI, session issuance, and runtime configuration all live inside the customer's Docker Compose. No external SaaS dashboard is required for the product to function. The management UI is bundled into the self-op Fastify engine; Gitea is the auth/storage substrate; admin sessions are session-cookie-based (PR #28 + appendix #3 cookie-scope fix-up — no JWT in v0.1). This is the operational corollary of #5 — *UI-first* means self-hosted UI, not "configure via a hosted dashboard." It is also why "managed opencoo hosting" is a non-goal in v0.1 (`PRD.md` §8): the moment a hosted plane becomes load-bearing for a customer, sovereignty leaks.
12. **Proactive curation is load-bearing, not optional.** Heartbeat (daily), Lint (weekly), and Index rebuilder (every 6h) are not features layered on top of a wiki — they are the mechanism by which a compiled wiki stays coherent over months. A reactive-only "company brain" — one that only answers when asked, never compacting, contradiction-checking, or pruning — decays into stale pages, orphans, and unsurfaced contradictions. An agent platform built without these scheduled pipelines does not produce a comparable product, even with identical adapters.

## 3. Core domain model

The organizational unit is a **knowledge domain** (e.g. `wiki-executive`, `wiki-hr`, `wiki-ops`). Each domain has:

- Its own Gitea repo.
- Its own **LLM policy** — which provider/models process its data. This is a **data-sovereignty feature**: e.g. HR data can be pinned to local Ollama so it never leaves the premises. A policy-pinned domain hard-rejects out-of-policy LLM calls with a typed error (no silent fallback).
- Its own access control via Gitea teams.
- A bounded Thinker-compiled **`worldview.md`** (default 6000-token ceiling) — synthesis of priorities, active initiatives, key people, recent material changes, resolved + open contradictions. Refreshed on impact triggers (per-commit `Worldview-Impact: high|medium|low` trailers), not on every edit.

Multi-domain deployments additionally get a **`company.md`** on the aggregator domain, compiled from the per-domain worldviews (not their underlying pages). This delegates sovereignty correctly — cloud-routed aggregation only sees content that already passed through the source domain's LLM policy.

Worldview is injected into every agent's system prompt as persistent grounding. It is **not** retrieved at query time. Page-level **projections** (cross-domain compiles) are deferred to v2+.

Three domain classes:
- **`knowledge`** (default) — PDF / DOCX / transcript → compiled wiki page.
- **`catalog-workflows`** — n8n workflows round-trip losslessly via content-kind-gated Compiler templates. Nightly governance cadence; cloud-routed default.
- **`catalog-skills`** — agentskills.io `SKILL.md` bundles. Fed by SkillMiner + push-authoring. Quarterly cadence; local-pinned LLM-policy default.

## 4. Three-tier LLM strategy

Every LLM call picks a tier. This is a cost/capability knob, not cosmetic:

- **Thinker** — strategic compilation, contradiction detection, gap analysis, Heartbeat report, cross-domain aggregation.
- **Worker** — document classification, single-source page creation, conversational responses.
- **Light** — index/log entries, formatting, metadata.

Every call records `timestamp, engine, tier, model, pipeline/agent, document/run_id, tokens_in, tokens_out, cost, latency` to the `llm_usage` table. Clients need this to understand their operational costs. Full prompts/responses go to `llm_usage_debug` (7-day TTL) only when `LLM_DEBUG_LOG=1`.

All LLM calls route through `packages/shared/llm-router/`. An ESLint boundary rule (`no-direct-llm-sdk`) forbids `@ai-sdk/*` imports outside that package. Per-domain `llm_policy` is enforced at every call; per-domain monthly spend cap (`llm_budget_monthly_cap_usd`) pauses queues and alerts on breach — fail-closed.

## 5. Pipelines (Ingestion engine)

Eight BullMQ workers:

1. **Scanner** (every 4h) — discover new/changed source docs, dedupe, queue.
2. **Webhook receiver** — HMAC-verified, rate-limited, payload-capped; transport-only.
3. **Classifier** — Worker tier; structured-output-only (Zod-validated); path-allow-list validation rejects cross-domain writes silently to DLQ.
4. **Compiler** — Thinker tier; per-domain LLM policy; atomic `wikiWrite` per run; populates frontmatter provenance (`schema_version`, `prompt_version`, `compiled_at`, `compiled_by_run_id`) and `page_citations` rows.
5. **Index rebuilder** (every 6h) — keeps `index.md` current per domain.
6. **Review dispatcher** — routes flagged items to the Review Dashboard.
7. **SkillMiner** — weekly per `catalog-skills` domain; two-pass (Worker Detector → Thinker Synthesizer) induction of agentskills.io-format SKILL.md files from compiled transcripts + `agent_runs`.
8. **Cleanup** (weekly) — retention pruning on `ingestion_intake`, `webhook_events`, `llm_usage` only. Compiled wiki pages are never retention-purged.

Four-level idempotency keys (Intake / Webhook / Classifier / Compiler) + three-class `ErrorClass` taxonomy (Transient / UpstreamQuota / Validation) drive retry policy. Validation errors → immediate DLQ (no retry).

## 6. First-party agents (Self-Operating engine)

Five definitions, one harness, one `agent_runs` audit table (which doubles as the memory substrate):

1. **Heartbeat** — weekday-morning Thinker run per configured instance (e.g. `ceo-heartbeat`, `ops-heartbeat`); max 5 alerts, leads with #1 priority; delivered via bound `OutputAdapter`. Default memory: last 3 runs.
2. **Lint** — weekly; contradictions, stale pages, orphans, missing cross-refs, prompt-version drift, automation drift, `allowed_paths: ["**"]` bindings, redaction-pattern-disabled bindings. Synthetic `Worldview-Impact: high` for contradictions that hit worldview-level facts.
3. **Chat** — scoped by caller's Gitea PAT; per-session memory only, never persisted across sessions.
4. **Surfacer** — reads wiki (read-only); proposes `automation_candidates` (`status: 'proposed'`); never self-approves (gate 1).
5. **Builder** — runs on `status: 'approved'` candidates (gate 2); composes skills from `builtin:* < marketplace:* < overlay:*`; deploys to n8n **disabled** (gate 3 is always-manual and non-configurable); writes wiki backlinks on source pages; records `skills_used: [{slug, version, sha, source}]` per run.

## 7. Adapter boundaries

Six adapter interfaces. A new integration = one package implementing one interface + a `credentialSchema` (JSON Schema). The management UI **renders the config form dynamically from the schema** — do not hardcode integration-specific UI. Fields with `x-credential-field: { secret: true }` are encrypted at rest and masked in logs and UI.

| Adapter | Responsibility | v0.1 examples |
|---|---|---|
| `SourceAdapter` | Fetch source bytes; emit `SourceEvent` | `source-drive`, `source-asana`, `source-fireflies`, `source-n8n`, `source-skill-bundle` |
| `WikiAdapter` | Write compiled pages to the wiki backend | `wiki-gitea` (reference) |
| `OutputAdapter` | Deliver agent outputs | `output-asana` (v0.1; `output-slack` deferred to v2) |
| `AutomationAdapter` | Platform-specific automation tools + `builderSkills` bundle + `credentialSchema`. **One active per deployment.** | `automation-n8n-mcp` (v0.1 default) |
| `GuardAdapter` | Prompt-injection detection, content safety, or **redaction** (secret/PII scrubbing on structured payloads) | `guard-redaction-regex` (v0.1) |
| `DocumentConverterAdapter` | Source bytes → clean Markdown; per-domain sovereignty gating | Docling sidecar (default) |

`packages/adapters/source-drive/` is the reference `SourceAdapter` to model new ones after. Every adapter passes a shared contract-test suite (`packages/shared/adapter-contract-tests/*`).

## 8. Intended stack

TypeScript throughout. Fastify for HTTP (ingestion + self-op, one process each). React UI **bundled as static files and served by the self-op Fastify** — one process, one port, one container. PostgreSQL for state + audit; BullMQ + Redis for job queues; Drizzle ORM + `drizzle-kit` for schema-as-TypeScript and SQL migrations. pnpm workspaces + Turborepo. Docker Compose for deployment (GHCR + Docker Hub images, digest-pinned).

No Python services in core. Docling is a sidecar, not in-process. No Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint (UI surfaces `agent_runs` + `llm_usage` instead). No distributed tracing in v0.1 (BullMQ job IDs + `agent_runs.id` are the correlation story).

Four ESLint boundary rules are load-bearing for the architecture:
- `no-cross-engine-import` — `engine-ingestion/` and `engine-self-operating/` cannot import each other.
- `no-direct-gitea-write` — only `packages/shared/wiki-write/` touches the Gitea API (provisioning job is the single exception).
- `no-direct-llm-sdk` — `@ai-sdk/*` imports are confined to `packages/shared/llm-router/`.
- `no-feature-env-vars` — new `process.env.*` outside the allow-list fails lint.

## 9. Security posture (summary)

Full details in `THREAT-MODEL.md`. Non-negotiable invariants:

- **XML spotlighting** on every LLM call that includes untrusted or LLM-generated content (`<source_content>`, `<worldview>` wrapping). Load-bearing whether or not a `GuardAdapter` is configured.
- **Structured output only** from Classifier and Compiler (Zod-typed JSON; no free-form prose field).
- **No cross-domain writes** — `target_pages[].path` validates against the source binding's `allowed_paths` AND lives inside the binding's target domain.
- **Credentials referenced by ID**, never by value, in adapter payloads. App-layer AES-256-GCM with AAD binding to credential ID; `CredentialStore` interface so KMS/Vault backends plug in later.
- **Gate 3 (workflow activation in n8n) is manual and non-configurable** — no admin toggle, no env var, no CLI override.
- **Append-only audit tables**: `page_citations`, `redaction_events`, `erasure_log`, `miner_suppressions`, `agent_runs`. Engine code never UPDATEs or DELETEs. Cleanup is the only exception (retention pruning).
- **Prompt-injection corpus in CI** — `packages/shared/prompts/__fixtures__/injection/` covers direct / indirect / cross-domain-write / path-traversal / unicode-homoglyph / data-exfiltration attempts; a regression is a phase-a ship-blocker.

## 10. Design system

Self-contained Agent Skill under `design_system/`. Always start at `design_system/README.md`. Non-negotiables (see the skill for the full list):

- Product name is lowercase **`opencoo`** in prose. Never `OpenCoo` or `Open Coo`.
- Three type families, one job each: `Instrument Serif` italic (display/lede), `Geist` (UI), `JetBrains Mono` (paths, IDs, shortcuts).
- Three accents with fixed meaning: **Advisory Amber** (agent layer, under 10% per screen), **Wiki Teal** (compiled-knowledge chrome only), **Alert Red** (destructive/flagged).
- **No gradients. No drop shadows for elevation.** Depth = border + background shift. No fully-rounded buttons. No emoji.
- One motion loop only: the heartbeat pulse on the operate glyph. Everything else is one-shot ease-out.

Diagrams live under `diagrams/` with a shared `theme.css` that wires the design-system palette into mermaid output.

## 11. Repository layout

```
packages/
  shared/              — schema, logger, errors, LLM router, cost tracker,
                         credential store, wiki-write, text-normalize, prompts,
                         adapter-contract-tests
  engine-ingestion/    — Fastify boot + eight BullMQ pipelines (PRs 13–17)
  engine-self-operating/ — Fastify boot + agent harness + five first-party agents
                         + Review Dashboard + UI host (PRs 18–22, 28–29)
  ui/                  — React app, bundled as static files into self-op
  adapters/<kind>-<slug>/ — one package per adapter
  cli/                 — `opencoo` binary
  gitea-wiki-mcp-server/  — already shipping, Apache-2.0, separately npm-published
```

Schema-ownership rule: `packages/shared/db/schema/*` is the single source of truth for every `pgTable`. Every other package imports — never redefines.
