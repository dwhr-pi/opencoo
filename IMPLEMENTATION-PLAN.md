# opencoo v0.1 — Implementation Plan

> Phased, gated, dependency-ordered delivery plan for the implementing Claude Code team.
> Every deliverable has a **test written first** (TDD), a **verify command**, and an **exit criterion**.
> No deliverable advances past its gate until the gate is green.
>
> Read first: `PRD.md` (what + why), `CONVENTIONS.md` (TDD/TS/testing discipline), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (contributor-facing shapes) / `architecture.md` (internal design-of-record; local, gitignored), `THREAT-MODEL.md` (security checklist per subsystem).

## Progress snapshot (as of 2026-04-24)

**Phase-a: 10 / 32 PRs merged** (plus the §0 pre-coding gate). `main` is at commit `d0e957b`; all 583 workspace tests green + 1 skipped (gated Docling contract). No Docker installed yet — pglite + mock clients for all use-case tier tests.

| # | IMPL PR | GitHub PR | Merge commit | Title | THREAT-MODEL coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | §0 gate | #1 | `c436d56` | pnpm/turbo workspace + 4 ESLint boundary rules | invariants 2 / 5 / 9 / 10 |

| 8 | PR 07 | #8 | `7be9252` | llm-router + cost-tracker + budget-cap + `llm_usage_debug` migration | invariants 5, 11; **§7 residual "no hard LLM spend cap" CLOSED** |

| 11 | PR 10 | #11 | `d0e957b` | converter-docling + `DocumentConverterAdapter` contract suite (first adapter package) | §3.2 full |

**What's complete structurally:**
- §1.2.1 Shared foundations — **COMPLETE** (7 of 7 PRs). Foundations checkpoint passed 2026-04-24 — all tests in-memory, zero Docker, zero network.
- §1.2.2 wiki-write + MCP — **COMPLETE** (2 of 2 PRs).
- §1.2.3 Document conversion + guards — **1 of 3 PRs** (PR 10 converter-docling done; PRs 11 wiki-gitea + 12 guard-redaction-regex pending).

**Team workflow in use:** per-PR team cycle via the `opencoo-phase-a` agent team — planner drafts plan, orchestrator approves, implementer executes TDD, simplifier refines, reviewer gates (with explicit `/security-review` on THREAT-MODEL-touching PRs). Squash-merge to main after CI green. Each PR's closed GitHub branch preserves the full TDD-ordered commit history for bisect.

**Residual advisories filed across PRs 7-11** (all non-blocking, v0.2 hardening or future-PR reactivity): listed in each PR's body on GitHub. Tracked for the phase-a exit-gate `CHANGES-v0.1.md` draft.

**Next PR** (paused): PR 11 `packages/adapters/wiki-gitea` — first PR that definitely needs Docker (Gitea service-containers for contract-tier tests). Colima install lands with it per the orchestrator plan (`~/.claude/plans/we-are-starting-implementation-radiant-diffie.md`).

## 0. Pre-coding gate (before Phase a starts)

**Gate condition:** the design-partner PoC is end-to-end production-stable (CLAUDE.md "No opencoo TypeScript is written until the PoC is end-to-end production-stable").

**Exit criteria (all must hold before opening the first TypeScript PR):**

- [x] Pilot PoC runs every pipeline in production for ≥ two consecutive weeks without manual intervention beyond normal operator triage.
- [x] Pilot prompts are frozen and tagged. Committed to `packages/shared/prompts/pl/` staging branch (gitignored until phase-a PR 01 lands).
- [x] `architecture.md` refinement PR merged, capturing every PoC-discovered edge case, prompt revision, and flow that didn't survive contact with production.
- [x] `docs/local/` is authoritative for "what runs today"; no conflict between PoC operational truth and the OSS spec.
- [x] `DECISIONS.md` is empty (zero open items) or every open item is explicitly deferred with an owner.
- [x] Repo has `pnpm` + `turbo` + Drizzle + vitest toolchain bootstrapped (repo-root `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`). (PR #1, commit `c436d56`)
- [x] **`eslint.config.js` present at repo root with four custom boundary rules enforced.** Each rule ships with a negative-case fixture that would lint-pass without the rule and lint-fail with it — proving the rule is doing what it says (the rules are load-bearing for the rest of the plan; they must exist before PR 01 opens). _(PR #1; 5th rule `no-update-append-only` added in PR #4 once the invariant-8 table set stabilised.)_
  - `no-cross-engine-import` — `packages/engine-ingestion/**` cannot import from `packages/engine-self-operating/**` and vice versa (`architecture.md` §2.5; THREAT-MODEL §2 invariant 10).
  - `no-direct-gitea-write` — non-provisioning code cannot import the Gitea API client directly; must go through `packages/shared/wiki-write` (THREAT-MODEL §2 invariant 2).
  - `no-direct-llm-sdk` — `@ai-sdk/*` / Vercel AI SDK imports are forbidden outside `packages/shared/llm-router` (THREAT-MODEL §2 invariant 5).
  - `no-feature-env-vars` — `process.env.*` outside the allow-list (`DATABASE_URL`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PORT`, `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` + their `_FILE` variants, plus `NODE_ENV`, `LLM_DEBUG_LOG`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`) is a lint error (THREAT-MODEL §2 invariant 9). _(`LOG_LEVEL` added in PR #5.)_
- [x] `pnpm lint` green on the empty repo. `pnpm lint` on each negative-case fixture file fails with the expected rule ID.

---

## 1. Phase a — Pilot cutover parity + `catalog-workflows`

Ships as `0.1.0-a.N` tags. **Gates the pilot migration.** Nothing activates in the partner's environment until phase-a exits green. (CLAUDE.md "v0.1 ship sequence", §17 Resolved "Pilot migration path")

### 1.1 Entry gate

- [x] All §0 exit criteria green.
- [x] CI is able to run `pnpm test` on an empty repo (vitest configured, one trivial passing test). This proves the harness before any real test lands. _(Verified on PR #1 merge.)_

### 1.2 Deliverables (dependency-ordered)

Each deliverable is a PR-sized unit. Larger items (Review Dashboard, engines) are explicitly split into sub-deliverables. Every PR follows the TDD Red → Verify Red → Green → Verify Green → Refactor cycle from `CONVENTIONS.md`.

> **How to read this table.** *Test-first artifact* = the failing test written before any production code. *Acceptance* = what must be true at merge. *Verify* = the exact command that proves it. *Files* = a rough budget — PRs that blow through this by 2× need a reviewer heads-up, not a rule-break.

#### 1.2.1 Shared foundations (PRs 01–07)

Schema first (per CLAUDE.md + `architecture.md` §14.4 "schema-ownership rule"), then logger/errors/normalize, then the load-bearing shared services. These are pre-requisites for every later PR.

**Phase-a foundations checkpoint:** after PR 07, run `pnpm test` at repo root — every use-case test written so far passes in-memory, no Docker touched, **no network calls** (every `MockLLMClient` fixture is pre-recorded and offline-playable; recording workflow documented in `packages/shared/testing/record-llm.ts` shipped as part of PR 07). If any test needs Docker or network to pass, a fixture is missing; fix before moving on. (`architecture.md` §14.3; `CONVENTIONS.md` §3.1)

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### 1.3 Phase-a exit gate

All must hold before tagging `0.1.0-a.N` and starting phase b:

- [ ] PRD §5 criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 all green in CI. (Criteria 11 and 12 are phase-b and phase-c gates respectively; see §2.3 / §3.3.)
- [ ] **Pilot cuts over on phase-a code.** At least one pipeline runs on opencoo in parallel with the n8n equivalent; opencoo output quality ≥ n8n baseline on reviewer sign-off. The design partner begins operating on phase-a without waiting for SkillMiner — **SkillMiner adoption is a dedicated post-cutover sub-task in phase b** (CLAUDE.md "v0.1 ship sequence"; `architecture.md` §17 Resolved "Pilot migration path"). This is the single most important exit criterion.
- [ ] THREAT-MODEL §5 PR checklist run on the phase-merge commit — every box ticked or residual risk added to §7.
- [ ] `CHANGES-v0.1.md` drafted with breaking-change list from pre-release to `a.N`.

---

## 2. Phase b — `catalog-skills` + SkillMiner

Ships as `0.1.0-b.N` tags. Ships once phase-a is stable in pilot production. **This is the phase where the partner adopts SkillMiner via a dedicated sub-task** — phase-a does not ship SkillMiner to the partner, even though the phase-a foundations PRs create its storage (PRs 02, 03). The separation exists because SkillMiner is a deliberate scope-stretch past pilot-PoC parity (CLAUDE.md; `architecture.md` §17 Resolved "Pilot migration path") and the partner's production stability during cutover must not be coupled to an unproven pipeline.

### 2.1 Entry gate

- [ ] Phase-a exit gate green.
- [ ] Pilot has run phase-a deliverables in production for **≥ two weeks without a severity-1 incident**. This two-week soak is the adoption contract: the partner's environment is demonstrably stable on phase-a code before any SkillMiner behavior turns on.
- [ ] `miner_suppressions` + `catalog_candidate` + `miner_runs` tables present (should be, from PR 02 — recheck).

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 33 | `catalog-skills` class + Compiler template | PR 16 | `compiler-catalog-skill.test.ts` — `content_kind: 'skill-bundle'` bypasses DocumentConverter; Compiler template frontmatter-merge only; SKILL.md body verbatim; quarterly cadence; local-pinned LLM policy default | Catalog domain creation seeds default redaction pattern list (THREAT-MODEL §3.3) | `pnpm --filter engine-ingestion test compiler-catalog-skill` | ~10 |
| 34 | `source-skill-bundle` adapter | PR 33 | `source-skill-bundle.contract.test.ts` — unpacks `.skill` bundles; `content_kind: 'skill-bundle'` always; deterministic `source_revision` from bundle hash | Dedup on bundle SHA | `pnpm --filter source-skill-bundle test:contract` | ~8 |
| 35 | SkillMiner — Pass 1 Worker Detector | PRs 03, 07, 33 | `miner-detector.test.ts` — reads only from `scan_domains` on the binding; **schema test: the miner-binding row persists `scan_domains: string[]` column with `default '{}'` (Postgres empty-array); inserting a binding without `scan_domains` resolves to `[]`; creating a binding whose `scan_domains` contains a `catalog-*` slug is rejected at the DB layer with a typed error**; when `scan_domains = []` the detector is a no-op (writes a `miner_runs` row with `candidate_count: 0` and exits); `instance_count ≥ 3 ∧ confidence ≥ 0.7`; consults `miner_suppressions` by `pattern_fingerprint` (NFC + lowercase + stopwords-removed-per-locale + SHA-256); sovereignty: excludes `agent_runs` whose instance domain_scope doesn't intersect `scan_domains` (THREAT-MODEL §3.12) | `miner_runs` row per invocation regardless of candidate count | `pnpm --filter engine-ingestion test miner-detector` | ~12 |
| 36 | SkillMiner — Pass 2 Thinker Synthesizer + pre-summarization | PR 35 | `miner-synthesizer.test.ts` — pre-summarization sub-step when evidence > ~6k tokens; drafts agentskills.io-format `SKILL.md`; output-side redaction on `draft_payload.skill_md` (THREAT-MODEL §3.12); LLM policy inherits from target `catalog-skills` domain | `catalog_candidate` row written; status `detected → drafted` | `pnpm --filter engine-ingestion test miner-synthesizer` | ~10 |
| 37 | Review Dashboard — 5th item type (skill candidates) + slug-collision Supersede flow | PRs 28, 36 | `review-candidates.test.ts` — skill-candidate item type; slug-collision Supersede writes through `wikiWrite`; reject writes `miner_suppressions` row with reviewer + reason | Candidate never auto-promotes; quarterly review is advisory only | `pnpm --filter engine-self-operating test review-candidates` | ~12 |
| 38 | Miner UI tab + suppressions management | PRs 29, 37 | `miner-ui.test.ts` — suppressions list / un-suppress / view rejected reason; scan-window override; `opencoo miner run` CLI verb (§14.5) | | `pnpm --filter ui test:e2e miner` | ~10 |
| 39 | Redaction audit table + Execution Log integration | PRs 12, 28 | `redaction-audit.test.ts` — every redaction hit emits `redaction_events` row; Execution Log view surfaces them; content never logged | Append-only; Cleanup honors retention | `pnpm --filter engine-self-operating test redaction-audit` | ~6 |
| 40 | Phase-b e2e: miner produces candidates + marketplace gates accept stub | PRs 36, 38 | PRD §5 criterion 11 (and 12 stub — full marketplace in phase c) | | `pnpm test:e2e miner` | ~4 |

### 2.3 Phase-b exit gate

- [ ] PRD §5 criterion 11 green.
- [ ] Pilot has run SkillMiner on its own `agent_runs` for one quarterly cycle; at least one candidate reviewed.
- [ ] No severity-1 redaction incident (i.e. zero `redaction_events` rows where content leaked to a committed wiki page).
- [ ] THREAT-MODEL §5 checklist re-run.

---

## 3. Phase c — Overlay + marketplace live-fetch polish

Ships as `0.1.0-c.N` tags. Rolls up into `0.1.0` once stable at ≥ 1 partner.

### 3.1 Entry gate

- [ ] Phase-b exit gate green.
- [ ] Pilot or second partner has `automation-n8n-mcp` actively deploying workflows (disabled, gate-3 respected).

### 3.2 Deliverables

| PR | Title | Depends on | Test-first artifact | Acceptance | Verify | Files est. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 41 | Partner Builder-skill overlay loader | PR 25 | `overlay-loader.test.ts` — overlay repo loaded on adapter start + on-change; max-files + max-total-size enforced at load (DoS prevention — THREAT-MODEL §3.11); precedence `overlay > marketplace > builtin` on slug collision | Overlay is a Builder-skill source, full stop; not MCP-registered, not SkillMiner-fed | `pnpm --filter automation-n8n-mcp test overlay-loader` | ~8 |
| 42 | Management UI: Automation → "Builder skill overlay repo" — Create-in-Gitea + Use-existing-URL | PR 41 | `overlay-ui.test.ts` — create flow uses admin Gitea token to pre-seed repo + README + `skill-template.md` + team grant; use-existing validates URL + read access on save (§17 Resolved "Partner Builder-skill overlay") | One-time per-partner | `pnpm --filter ui test:e2e overlay` | ~10 |
| 43 | Marketplace live-fetch loop + `marketplace_updates` table UX | PR 25 | `marketplace-fetch.test.ts` — weekly polling of `czlonkowski/n8n-skills` Releases API; `target_commitish` verified AND tarball tree-SHA recomputed; fails closed on mismatch; writes `marketplace_updates` row with diff. **Never auto-activates a new skill version — assertion: after a fixture release becomes available, the Builder agent's resolved skill set still reports the vendored-pinned versions until `marketplace_updates.status` transitions to `'accepted'` via the Review Dashboard (PR 44); `agent_runs.skills_used` written by a post-fetch Builder run carries the old `sha`, not the new one** (THREAT-MODEL §3.11) | Air-gap partners can disable at setup wizard; disabled-fetch state is explicit, not an error | `pnpm --filter automation-n8n-mcp test marketplace-fetch` | ~10 |
| 44 | Review Dashboard — Marketplace Updates entries | PRs 28, 43 | `review-marketplace.test.ts` — 4th item type surfaces diff + accept/skip; accept persists new pin SHA + refreshes vendored cache | Rejected updates do not re-surface until a newer version appears | `pnpm --filter engine-self-operating test review-marketplace` | ~8 |
| 45 | Phase-c e2e: marketplace-gates-accept + upgrade-preserves-overrides | PRs 43, 30 | PRD §5 criteria 10, 12 | | `pnpm test:e2e upgrade marketplace` | ~4 |

### 3.3 Release gate — `0.1.0`

All must hold before tagging `0.1.0`:

- [ ] Every PRD §5 criterion green — including criterion 13 (at least one pipeline demonstrably cut over at the design partner, n8n version paused, opencoo version live).
- [ ] THREAT-MODEL §6 release checklist run end-to-end.
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` reviewed; maintainer MFA + vulnerability-reporting address still valid.
- [ ] `CHANGES-v0.1.md` complete: every breaking change, every new default, every migration action from pre-release to `0.1.0`.
- [ ] Docker images pushed to GHCR + Docker Hub with GPG-signed release tags; CI verified signatures before publish.
- [ ] `deploy/BACKUP.md` present; `docker-compose.yml` volumes annotated with backup=yes/no/cache.
- [ ] `opencoo doctor` run against a fresh install — every check passes.
- [ ] Install telemetry payload shape matches the documented schema (or CHANGES entry + UI wizard update).
- [ ] Partner sign-off on PRD §5 criterion 13.

## 4. Risk register

Delivery risks that can block the plan (distinct from the security residual risks in THREAT-MODEL §7).

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to escalate |
|---|---|---|---|
| PoC doesn't stabilize in time | Medium | Pre-coding gate is explicit; we don't start phase-a early | Any attempt to open phase-a PR 01 before §0 exit criteria green |
| Pilot cutover stalls at criterion 13 | Medium | Phase-a is releasable at `0.1.0-a.N`; partner doesn't need `0.1.0` to operate | Three consecutive weeks without a pipeline cutover |
| Injection corpus proves too permissive | Medium | Phase-a PR 31 is a hard gate; fixtures expand as new classes are found | Any production prompt-injection incident |
| LLM provider deprecation mid-phase | Low | Per-domain policy means one domain's breakage is contained; router has typed errors, not silent fallback | Any provider SDK major-version bump |
| Adapter contract tests flaky in CI | Medium | Contract tests against real systems use service-containers, not live APIs, where feasible; pin SDK versions | Flake rate > 5% on any contract suite |
| Drizzle schema divergence PR-to-PR | Low | CLAUDE.md + `architecture.md` §14.4 name the single-ownership rule; ESLint enforces; schema-first PR ordering | Any PR adding a `pgTable` outside `packages/shared/db/schema/` |
| Overlay / marketplace DoS attack surface | Medium | Phase-c PR 41 enforces max-files + max-total-size at load | CI fuzz test catches a path that OOMs the loader |

## 5. Out-of-band operating rules

Independent of phase.

- **Update documentation in the same PR** that changes the code it describes. `architecture.md`, `THREAT-MODEL.md` §3, `DECISIONS.md`, and this plan drift silently if this rule is violated.
- **Prefer editing** this plan over spawning a new doc. Phases expand; the structure does not.
- **Gate discipline is non-negotiable.** Skipping phase-a exit criteria to start phase-b is how quality regressions ship.
- **One adapter per package.** Adding an integration = adding a package + a `credentialSchema` + passing the shared contract suite. The shared suite lives in `packages/shared/adapter-contract-tests/`.
- **No new env vars for feature config.** Ever. (THREAT-MODEL §2 invariant 9.) If a PR proposes one, push back to Postgres + UI.
